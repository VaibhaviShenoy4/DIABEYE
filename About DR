Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. 
It is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to prolonged high blood sugar levels.
DR is one of the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness worldwide, especially among working-age adults.

Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy
1.No DR: No signs of retinal damage.
2.Mild DR: Early signs, including small bulges in blood vessels (microaneurysms).
3.Moderate DR: Progression with swelling and more noticeable blood vessel damage.
4.Severe DR: Blockages in blood vessels, leading to oxygen deprivation in the retina.
5.Proliferative DR: Advanced stage where abnormal blood vessels grow on the retina, causing severe vision issues.

Symptoms
*Blurred vision
*Floaters or dark spots in vision
*Difficulty seeing colors
*Sudden vision loss (in severe cases)

Risk Factors
-Poorly controlled blood sugar levels
-Long duration of diabetes
-High blood pressure or cholesterol
-Smoking

Importance of Early Detection
Early detection and management of DR can prevent severe vision loss.
Regular eye screenings, especially for diabetic patients, play a critical role in identifying and treating the condition at an early stage.
