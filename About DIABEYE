Introduction
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness among diabetic patients worldwide. 
Accurate and timely detection of DR can help in early intervention, significantly reducing the risk of severe outcomes. 
This project focuses on developing and evaluating a comprehensive deep learning framework, DIABEYE, to classify DR using retinal fundus images. We explore datasets from the coastal region of Mangalore, Karnataka, for real-time applicability and compare model performances across various datasets.

Problem Statement
Diabetic Retinopathy detection often suffers from reduced accuracy due to the lack of regional specificity and diverse datasets.
There is a need for a reliable and accurate system that performs well on real-time data from specific geographic regions, such as the coastal area of Mangalore. Current methods lack comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets.

Objective
To design a robust diabetic retinopathy classification system that enhances accuracy for real-time datasets collected from the coastal region of Mangalore while performing a comparative analysis of four pre-trained deep learning models:
DenseNet121, MobileNet, VGG16, and InceptionV3.

Methodology
1) Data Collection:
   - Real-time dataset from KS Hegde Hospital
   - Kaggle dataset with labeled severity levels
   - Merged dataset combining Kaggle and real-time data
2) Models Used for Comparative Study:
   - DenseNet121
   - MobileNet
   - VGG16
   - InceptionV3
3) Training and Evaluation:
The models were trained and tested on the three datasets: Real-time, Kaggle, and Merged.
Accuracy metrics were evaluated to identify the best-performing model.

Results
DenseNet121 consistently outperformed the other models across all datasets, achieving the highest accuracy for the real-time data. This performance can be attributed to the similarity between the real-time and merged dataset's geographic region, highlighting the importance of dataset relevance.
Future Scope
1. Dataset Expansion: Incorporate more real-time data from diverse geographic regions.
2. Model Optimization: Explore ensemble techniques and fine-tuning for further accuracy improvement.
3. Deployment: Develop an integrated web-based or mobile-friendly application for clinical use.
4. Explainability: Implement visualization techniques like Grad-CAM for better model interpretability in medical applications.
